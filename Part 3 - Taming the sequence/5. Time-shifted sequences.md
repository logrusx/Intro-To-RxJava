# Time-shifted sequences

One of the key features in Rx is that it's unknown when items will be emitted. Some observables will emit everything immediately and synchronously(e.g. `range`), some emit on regular intervals, and some are hard or even impossible to predict. For example, mouse events and UDP packets simply arrive when they arrive. Tools are necessary to decide what to do with those events, not only based on what they are, but also based on when they arrived and at what frequency.

## Buffer

`buffer` accumulates values and provides them in bulks, rather than one at a time. There are several different ways of buffering values.

### Complete, non-overlapping buffering

The easiest form of buffering is the one where every value is buffered exactly ones with no loss and no duplication.

#### buffer by count

The simplest overload groups a fixed number of values together and emits the group when it's ready.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/buffer3.png)

```java
Observable.range(0, 10)
	.buffer(4)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/BufferExample.java)
```
[0, 1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6, 7]
[8, 9]
```

#### buffer by time

The next overload fills the buffer based on time. Time is divided into windows of equal length. Values are collected for each window and at the end of it the buffer is emitted.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/buffer5.png)

In the next example, the observable emits values every 100 ms and buffer them in windows of 250 ms. 

```java
Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(10)
	.buffer(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/BufferExample.java)
```
[0, 1]
[2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8]
[9]
```

The size of a collection depends on how many values were emitted in that time span and not on a desired size. The collection can even be empty, if there where no events during the window.

#### buffer by count and time

Both a buffer size and a time span can be used to buffer values. The buffered values are emitted if either the buffer is full or if the time slot ends and a new one starts.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/buffer6.png)

```java
Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.take(10)
	.buffer(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, 2)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/BufferExample.java)
```
[0, 1]
[]
[2, 3]
[]
[4, 5]
[6]
[7, 8]
[]
[9]
```

There are a lot of empty lists here. This is because the buffer is emitted both when it reaches size 2 and when a time window closes. As show in the previous example, only two values belong in those windows. Since the buffer was emptied when it reached size 2, it is empty when the window closes.

#### buffer with signal

Instead of fixed points in time, `buffer` can also be signaled with an observable to flush. Every time the signal emits onNext, the values in the buffer are be emitted. Buffering with a signal can be very useful if buffering values is necessary until the moment the subscriber is ready for them.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/buffer8.png)

The following example does the same as `.buffer(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)`

```java
Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(10)
	.buffer(Observable.interval(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```

There is an overload, where the signaling observable is provided through a lambda function: `.buffer(() -> Observable.interval(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))`. The difference here is that the function that creates the observable is executed when a subscription happens. It's also possible to start your signal when the subscription starts.

### Overlapping buffers

Every method for buffering above has an alternative that allows buffers to overlap or to leave out values.

#### buffer by count

When buffering based on the desired buffer size, it's possible to declare how far apart the beginnings of each buffer are too.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/buffer4.png)

As the marble diagram shows, a new buffer every 3 values is started but the buffer is limited to 2 values. Therefore, every third element is left out. It's also possible to start the new buffer before the previous buffer closes. 
* When `count` > `skip`, the buffers overlap
* When `count` < `skip`, elements are left out
* The case of `count` = `skip` is equivalent to the simpler case we saw in the previous subchapter.

Here's an example in code, where the buffers overlap

```java
Observable.range(0,10)
	.buffer(4, 3)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
Output
```
[0, 1, 2, 3]
[3, 4, 5, 6]
[6, 7, 8, 9]
[9]
```

As the output shows, a new buffer starts every 3 elements, and that buffer contains the next 4 elements.

#### buffer by time

A very similar thing can be done for the variant where buffering is based on a timespan.
![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/buffer7.png)
Once again, buffers either overlap or leave out elements.
* When `timespan` > `timeshift`, the buffers overlap
* When `timespan` < `timeshift`, elements are left out
* The case of `timespan` = `timeshift` is equivalent to the simpler case in the previous subchapter.

In the next example a buffer is created every 200 ms and collects for 350 ms. That means that buffers overlap by 150 ms.

```java
Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(10)
	.buffer(350, 200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/BufferExample.java)
```
[0, 1, 2]
[2, 3, 4]
[3, 4, 5, 6]
[5, 6, 7, 8]
[7, 8, 9]
[9]
```

#### buffer by signal

The last and most powerful overload of `buffer` starts and ends buffers using signaling observables.
```java
public final <TOpening,TClosing> Observable<java.util.List<T>> buffer(
	Observable<? extends TOpening> bufferOpenings,
	Func1<? super TOpening,? extends Observable<? extends TClosing>> bufferClosingSelector)
```
![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/buffer2.png)

This function takes two arguments. The first argument, `bufferOpenings`, is an observable. Every time this observable emits a value, a new buffer begins. Along with opening a new buffer, the value which it emitted is passed to the `bufferClosingSelector`, which is a function. This function uses the value to create a new observable, which signals the end of the corresponding buffer when it emits its first onNext event.

Let's see this in code:
```java
Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(10)
	.buffer(
		Observable.interval(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS),
		i -> Observable.timer(200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/BufferExample.java)
```
[2, 3]
[4, 5]
[7, 8]
[9]
```

The supplied `Observable.interval` signals the opening of a new buffer every 250 ms. Because observables created with `interval` do not immediately emit a value, and first buffer actually starts at 250 ms and the values emitted during that time are lost. For the closing of a buffer a lamba function function that takes every value emitted by `bufferOpenings` is supplied. The values generated by `interval` are the natural progression 0,1,2,3... but they aren't used since such an example would be too complicated. Instead, an observable that waits 200 ms and then emits a single value is supplied. That means that each buffer lasts exactly 200 ms, similarity to buffering by time.

### takeLastBuffer

The [takeLast](/Part%202%20-%20Sequence%20Basics/2.%20Reducing%20a%20sequence.md#skiplast-and-takelast) operator, which returns the last N number of items was already discussed in Part 2. Internally, `takeLast` needs to buffer items and re-emits them when the source sequence ends. The `takeLastBuffer` operator returns the last elements as one buffer.

#### By count

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/takeLastBuffer.png)

`takeLastBuffer` by count emits the last `N` elements in a list.

```java
Observable.range(0, 5)
	.takeLastBuffer(2)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/TakeLastBufferExample.java)
```
[3, 4]
```

#### By time

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/takeLastBuffer.tn.png)

`takeLastBuffer` by time emits the items that were received during the specified timespan as a buffer, which is measured from the end of the source sequence.

```java
Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.take(5)
	.takeLastBuffer(200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/TakeLastBufferExample.java)
```
[2, 3, 4]
```

#### By count and time

The buffer emitted by this overload of `takeLastBuffer` contains items that were emitted over the specified timespan before the end. If this window contains more than the specified number of items, the buffer emits only the last `N` items.

```java
Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.take(5)
	.takeLastBuffer(2, 200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/TakeLastBufferExample.java)
```
[3, 4]
```

As evident from the previous example, the last 200 ms include three values. `.takeLastBuffer(2, 200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)` specifies values will be collected during the last 200 ms, limited to 2 values. For that reason, only the last two values are printed.


## Delay

`delay`, as the name suggests, postpones the emission of values for a specified amount of time. The are two ways to do that. One is to store values for as long as necessary. The other is to delay the subscription to observable.

### delay

The simplest overload of `delay` delays every item by the same amount of time. It's like delaying the beginning of the sequence, while maintaining the time intervals between successive elements.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/delay.png)

Here's an example in code

```java
Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(5)
			.delay(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
			.timeInterval()
			.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/DelayExample.java)
```
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=1109, value=0]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=94, value=1]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=100, value=2]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=100, value=3]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=101, value=4]
```

Five values spaced 100 ms apart are created and then the sequence is delayed by 1 second. First value takes around 1000 + 100 ms and the next values take 100 ms each.

Each value can also delayed individually.
![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/delay.o.png)
This overload takes a function which creates an observable for each item. When that observable emits onNext, the corresponding item is emitted in the delayed sequence.

```java
Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(5)
	.delay(i -> Observable.timer(i * 100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))
	.timeInterval()
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/DelayExample.java)
```
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=152, value=0]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=173, value=1]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=199, value=2]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=201, value=3]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=199, value=4]
```

The initial sequence is spaced 100 ms apart, while the resulting is 200 ms. If you remember, `interval` emits the numbers i = 1,2,3,etc. We delay each item `i` by `i*100`, so the first item is delayed by 100 ms, then second by 200 ms, the third by 300 ms. The difference between the successive delays is 100 ms. Added to the initial 100 ms interval, that results in 200 ms interval between items.

### delaySubscription

Rather than storing values and emitting them later, the subscription can be delayed altogether. This will have a different effect depending on if the observable is hot or cold. Details can be found in [Hot and cold observables](/Part%203%20-%20Taming%20the%20sequence/6.%20Hot%20and%20Cold%20observables.md) chapter. For the examples so far, the observables are cold and subscription event is when the source observable is created (i.e. the beginning of the sequence). What that means is that there is no difference in the sequences between delaying each item by the same amount and delaying the subscription. Since that is the case here, delaying the subscription is more efficient, since the operator doesn't need to buffer items internally.

Let's see code for the different overloads for delaying a subscription
```java
Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(5)
	.delaySubscription(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.timeInterval()
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/DelayExample.java)
```
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=1114, value=0]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=92, value=1]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=101, value=2]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=100, value=3]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=99, value=4]
```

Output demonstrates the `interval` observable (i.e. its creation) subscription was delayed by 1000 ms. After that, the sequence goes as defined.

A subscription can also be delayed based on a signaling observable through the following overload:
```java
public final <U> Observable<T> delaySubscription(Func0<? extends Observable<U>> subscriptionDelay)
```

The argument is a function that will create a new observable for each subscription. The subscription is delayed until the corresponding observable emits a value. The following example is equivalent to the one we've just seen.

```java
Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(5)
	.delaySubscription(() -> Observable.timer(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))
	.timeInterval()
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```

### delay values and subscription

The last method in this category delays both the subscription and each item individually.
```java
public final <U,V> Observable<T> delay(
	Func0<? extends Observable<U>> subscriptionDelay,
	Func1<? super T,? extends Observable<V>> itemDelay)
```
![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/delay.oo.png)

This is a combination of the two ways previously discussed. The first argument is a function that creates an observable that will signal when to perform the subscription. The second argument takes every item and decides how long it should be delayed.

## Sample

`sample` thins out a sequence by dividing it into time windows and taking only one value out of each window. When each window ends, the last value within that window (if any) is emitted.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/sample.png)

```java
Observable.interval(150, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.sample(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/SampleExample.java)
```
5
12
18
...
```

The division of time isn't necessarily uniform. The end of each part can be signaled with an observable.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/sample.o.png)

The following code does the same thing as before
```java
Observable.interval(150, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.sample(Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```

## Throttling

Throttling is also intended for thinning out a sequence. When the producer emits more values than than desired and not every sequential value is needed, the sequence can be thinned out by throttling it.

### throttleFirst

The `throttleFirst` operator filters out values relative to the values that were already accepted. After a value has been accepted, values will be rejected for the duration of the window. Once The window expires, the next value will be accepted and a new window starts.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/throttleFirst.png)

```java
Observable.interval(150, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.throttleFirst(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/ThrottleExample.java)
```
0
7
14
...
```

Here, `interval` emits every 150 ms. The values seen as output were emitted at `(i+1)*150` ms, relative to the start of the sequence. The first item is emitted at 150 ms and is accepted by default. Now items are rejected for the next 1000 ms. The first item after that comes at 1200 ms. Again, items are rejected for the next 1000 ms, so the next item comes at 2250 ms.

### throttleLast

The `throttleLast` operator divides time at regular intervals, rather than relative to the last item. It emits the last value in each window, rather than the first after it.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/throttleLast.png)

```java
Observable.interval(150, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.throttleLast(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/ThrottleExample.java)
```
5
12
18
...
```

Here, a window starts with the creation of the sequence at 0 ms. That window expires at 1000 ms and the last value in that window was at 900 ms. The next window last 1000 ms until 2000 ms. The last item in that window is at 1950. In the next window, the item is at 2850 ms.

## Debouncing

In this operator, a time window starts every time a value is received. Once the window expires, the value is emitted. If, however, another value is received before the window expires, the previous value is discarded and the window restarts for the next value.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/debounce.s.png)

Demonstrating this is a bit more complicated, since an `interval` observable will either have all of its values accepted or only its last value accepted (which is never if the observable is infinite). For that reason a more complex observable has to be constructed:

```java
Observable.concat(
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3)
	)
	.scan(0, (acc, v) -> acc+1)
	.timeInterval()
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
Output
```
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=110, value=0]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=1, value=1]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=98, value=2]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=101, value=3]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=502, value=4]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=500, value=5]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=499, value=6]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=102, value=7]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=99, value=8]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=101, value=9]
```

The observable emits 4 values in quick succession, then 3 values in greater intervals and finally 3 values in quick succession. The `scan` only serves to turn the values into the natural sequence, rather than 3 repetitions of 1,2,3. The reason the first two emissions are simultaneous is that `scan` emits the initial value and the first value together.

Here's how `debounce` works:

```java
Observable.concat(
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3)
	)
	.scan(0, (acc, v) -> acc+1)
	.debounce(150, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/DebounceExample.java)
```
3
4
5
9
```

The window of debouncing is 150 ms. The bursts of emissions in the observable were faster than that (100 ms), so only the last value in each burst passed through. During the slower part of our observable, all the values were accepted, because the 150 ms window expired before the next value arrived.

There is a `throttleWithTimeout` operator which has the same behaviour as the `debounce` operator that we just saw.  One is practically an alias of the other, even though neither is officially declared as such in the documentation.

Debouncing can be done on a per item basis. In this case, `debounce` takes a function that calculates how long the window should be after each item. The window is using a new observable for each item. When the observable terminates, the window expires.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/debounce.f.png)

In the next example, the window size for each value `i` is `i*50` ms. 

```java
Observable.concat(
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3)
	)
	.scan(0, (acc, v) -> acc+1)
	.debounce(i -> Observable.timer(i * 50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))
	.subscribe(System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/DebounceExample.java)
```
1
3
4
5
9
```

This is a map of each item to the length of its window and the time that the next item actually arrives:

Item | Calculated Window | Time until next value | Window < next value
---- | ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------------
0 | 0 | 1 | 
1 | 50 | 98 | Yes
2 | 100 | 101 | (timed operations in Java are not 100% accurate)
3 | 150 | 502 | Yes
4 | 200 | 500 | Yes
5 | 250 | 499 | Yes
6 | 300 | 102 | 
7 | 350 | 99 | 
8 | 400 | 101 | 
9 | 450 |  | Yes

It's now clear why the values turned out to be so.


This operator is useful against observables that undergo periods of uncertainty, where the value changes frequently from one non-definitive state to another. For example, imagine the content of a text field is monitored and suggestions need to be offered based on what the user is writing. Suggestions can be recomputed on every keystroke, but that would be too noisy and too costly. Instead, debouncing the changes to the text field, offer suggestions only when the user has paused or finished typing.


## Timeout

`timeout` is used to detect observables that have remained inactive for a given period of time. If a specified amount of time passes without the source emitting any items, `timeout` makes the observable fail with a `TimeoutException`.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/timeout.1.png)

The composite observable from the examples of `debounce` is used to demonstrate `timeout`.

```java
Observable.concat(
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3)
	)
	.scan(0, (acc, v) -> acc+1)
	.timeout(200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.subscribe(
		System.out::println,
		System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/TimeoutExample.java)
```
0
1
2
3
java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException
```

The output mirrors the source observable for as long as values come more frequently than 200 ms. As soon as a value takes more than that to arrive, an error is pushed.

Instead of failing, a fallback observable can be supplied. When a timeout occurs, the resulting observable switches to the fallback. The original observable is ignored from then on, even if it resumes.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/timeout.2.png)

```java
Observable.concat(
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3)
	)
	.scan(0, (acc, v) -> acc+1)
	.timeout(200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, Observable.just(-1))
	.subscribe(
		System.out::println,
		System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/timeshifted/TimeoutExample.java)
```
0
1
2
3
-1
```

Timeout window per item can be specified as well. In that case, a function that creates an observable for each value should be supplied. When the observable terminates, that is the signal for the timeout. If no values had been emitted until that, that triggers the timeout.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/timeout5.png)

Here is the previous example, implemented using this overload.

```java
Observable.concat(
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3),
		Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).take(3)
	)
	.scan(0, (acc, v) -> acc+1)
	.timeout(i -> Observable.timer(200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))
	.subscribe(
		System.out::println,
		System.out::println);
```
A fallback observable can be provided here as well:
```java
.timeout(i -> Observable.timer(200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), Observable.just(-1))
```

The output is the same as the previous two examples
