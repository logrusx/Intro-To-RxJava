# Advanced error handling

In previous chapters, error handling in the observer was already discussed. However, by that time, it's practically outside the monad. There are many kinds of errors and not every error is worth pushing all the way to the top. In standard Java, exceptions can be caught at any level and a decision to handle it there or throw it further can be made. Similarly, in Rx, behaviour based on errors without terminating the observable and forcing the observer to deal with everything, can be defined.

## Resume

### onErrorReturn

The `onErrorReturn` operator ignores an error and emits one final value before terminating (successfully this time).

In the next example, an error is converted into a normal value:

```java
Observable<String> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext("Rx");
	o.onNext("is");
	o.onError(new Exception("adjective unknown"));
});

values
	.onErrorReturn(e -> "Error: " + e.getMessage())
	.subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v));
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/error/ResumeExample.java)
```
Rx
is
Error: adjective unknown
```

### onErrorResumeNext

The `onErrorResumeNext` resumes a failed sequence with another sequence. The error does not appear in the resulting observable.

```java
public final Observable<T> onErrorResumeNext(
    Observable<? extends T> resumeSequence)
public final Observable<T> onErrorResumeNext(
    Func1<java.lang.Throwable,? extends Observable<? extends T>> resumeFunction)
```

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/onErrorResumeNext.png)

The first overload uses the same followup observable in every case. The second overload allows for a decision what the resume sequence should be based on the error occurred.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext(1);
	o.onNext(2);
	o.onError(new Exception("Oops"));
});

values
	.onErrorResumeNext(Observable.just(Integer.MAX_VALUE))
	.subscribe(new PrintSubscriber("with onError: "));
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/error/ResumeExample.java)
```
with onError: 1
with onError: 2
with onError: 2147483647
with onError: Completed
```

Nothing prevents the resume sequence from failing as well. In fact, error type can be changed by returning an observable that fails immediately. In standard Java, components may decide they can't handle an error and that they should re-throw it. In such cases, it is common to provide additional context by wrapping the original error into a new exception. Here's how it's done in Rx:

```java
.onErrorResumeNext(e -> Observable.error(new UnsupportedOperationException(e)))
```

Now the sequence still fails, but the original error is wrapped into a new error. 

### onExceptionResumeNext

It only has one difference to `onErrorResumeNext`: it only catches errors that are `Exception`'s. 

```java
Observable<String> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext("Rx");
	o.onNext("is");
	//o.onError(new Throwable() {}); // this won't be caught
	o.onError(new Exception()); // this will be caught
});

values
	.onExceptionResumeNext(Observable.just("hard"))
	.subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v));
```

## Retry

If the error is non-deterministic, it may make sense to retry. `retry` re-subscribes to the source and emits everything again from the start.

```java
public final Observable<T> retry()
public final Observable<T> retry(long count)
```
![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/retry.png)

If the error doesn't go away, `retry()` will lock in an infinite loop of retries. The second overload limits the number of retries. If errors persist and the sequence fails n times, `retry(n)` will fail too. Let's see this in an example

```java
Random random = new Random();
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext(random.nextInt() % 20);
	o.onNext(random.nextInt() % 20);
	o.onError(new Exception());
});

values
	.retry(1)
	.subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v));
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/error/RetryExample.java)
```
0
13
9
15
java.lang.Exception
```

Here it's specified to retry only once. The observable fails after two values, then tries again, fails again. The second time it fails, the exception is allowed to pass through.

In this example, the subscription is stateful to demonstrate that the observable is restarted from the source: it produced different values the second time around. `retry` does not cache any elements like `replay`, nor would it make sense to do so. Retrying makes sense only if there are side effects, or if the observable is [hot](/Part%203%20-%20Taming%20the%20sequence/6.%20Hot%20and%20Cold%20observables.md).

### retryWhen

`retry` will restart the subscription as soon as the failure happens. If more control is needed, `retryWhen` can be used.

```java
public final Observable<T> retryWhen(
	Func1<? super Observable<? extends java.lang.Throwable>, ? extends Observable<?>> notificationHandler)
```

The argument to `retryWhen` is a function that takes an observable and returns another observable. The input observable emits all the errors that `retryWhen` encounters. The resulting observable signals when to retry: 
* if it emits a value, `retryWhen` will retry,
* if it terminates with error, `retryWhen` will emit the error and not retry.
* if it terminates successfully, `retryWhen` will terminate successfully.

Note that the type of the signaling observable and the actual values emitted don't matter. The values are discarded and the observable is only used for timing.

In the next example, policy with 100ms delay before retrying will be used.

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext(1);
	o.onNext(2);
	o.onError(new Exception("Failed"));
});

source.retryWhen((o) -> o
		.take(2)
		.delay(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))
	.timeInterval()
	.subscribe(
		System.out::println,
		System.out::println);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/error/RetryWhenExample.java)
```
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=21, value=1]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=0, value=2]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=104, value=1]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=0, value=2]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=103, value=1]
TimeInterval [intervalInMilliseconds=0, value=2]
```

The source observable emits 2 values and immediately fails. When that happens, the observable of failures inside `retryWhen` emits the error. That emission is delayed by 100 ms and sent back to signal a retry. `take(2)` guarantees that the signaling observable will terminate after two errors are received. `retryWhen` sees the termination and doesn't retry after the second failures.

## using

The `using` operator creates observables from resources that need to be managed. It guarantees that the resources will be managed regardless of when and how subscriptions are terminated. If `create` was used,  managing would have to be done in the traditional Java paradigm and injected into Rx. `using` is a more natural way of managing resources in Rx.

```java
public static final <T,Resource> Observable<T> using(
    Func0<Resource> resourceFactory,
    Func1<? super Resource,? extends Observable<? extends T>> observableFactory,
    Action1<? super Resource> disposeAction)
```

When a new subscription begins, `resourceFactory` leases the necessary resource. `observableFactory` uses that resource to produce items. When the resource is no longer needed, it is disposed of with the `disposeAction`. The dispose action is executed regardless of the way the subscription terminates (successfully or with a failure).

In the next example, a string is considered a resource that needs managing.

```java
Observable<Character> values = Observable.using(
	() -> {
		String resource = "MyResource";
		System.out.println("Leased: " + resource);
		return resource;
	},
	(resource) -> {
		return Observable.create(o -> {
			for (Character c : resource.toCharArray())
				o.onNext(c);
			o.onCompleted();
		});
	},
	(resource) -> System.out.println("Disposed: " + resource));

values
	.subscribe(
		v -> System.out.println(v),
		e -> System.out.println(e));
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/error/UsingExample.java)
```
Leased: MyResource
M
y
R
e
s
o
u
r
c
e
Disposed: MyResource
```

When `values` is subscribed to, the resource factory function is called which returns `"MyResource"`. That string is used to produce an observable which emits all the characters in the string. Once the subscription ends, the resource is disposed of. A `String` doesn't need any more managing than what the garbage collector will do. Resources may actually need such managing, e.g., database connections, opened files etc.

It is important to note here that terminating the observable must be done manually, just like when using the `create` method. With `create`, terminating is a matter of semantics. With `using`, not terminating defeats the point of using it in the first place. Only upon termination the resources will be released. If `o.onCompleted()` was to be called, the sequence would be assumed to be still active and needing its resources.
